# AtomBlog
WordPress competitor small blog

I'm trying to create a simple structure that can do whatever WordPress does in AtomBlog, but does not have a large number of files, file sizes, or many tables in the database, like WordPress. But it's not something that will happen overnight. It will develop gradually. It will evolve according to my needs. It is very important for me that it is as simple as the changelog right now. Because I'm someone who makes micro products myself. This is something I really need. This much. :)
